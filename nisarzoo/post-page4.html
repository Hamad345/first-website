       <p class="post-text">Three bird species belonging to the genera Pavo and Afropavo and belonging to the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies) are collectively referred to as peafowl. Although peafowl of either sex are frequently referred to as "peacocks" in casual language, male peafowl are known as peacocks and female peafowl as peahens.


        The only African species is the Congo peafowl, which is endemic to the Congo Basin. The two Asian species are the blue or Indian peafowl, which originated on the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia. Male peafowl are distinguished by their showy plumage and piercing sounds. The latter is particularly noticeable in Asian species, which have a "tail" or "train" of covert feathers with eye spots that they exhibit.</p>
