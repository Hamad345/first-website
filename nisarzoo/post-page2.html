       <p class="post-text">Bos taurus, or cattle, are big, domesticated animals with cloven hooves. They are the most prevalent species of the genus Bos and a major contemporary member of the subfamily Bovinae. Bulls and cows are terms used to describe mature male and female cattle, respectively. Young male cattle (bullocks), young female cattle (heifers), and castrated male cattle (steers) are all commonly referred to as "cows" in everyday speech.

        Cattle are frequently raised as livestock for their hides, which are used to create leather, for milk, and for meat (beef or veal; see beef cattle). They are utilised as draught animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, ploughs, and other implements) as well as riding animals. Cattle dung is another byproduct that can be utilised to make manure.</p>
