       <h2 class="sub-heading">Lions</h2>
       <p class="post-text">A huge cat of the species Panthera, the lion (Panthera leo) is indigenous to Africa and India. Its physique is broad-chested and strong, and it has round ears, a small, rounded head, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than females and have a noticeable mane because they are sexually dimorphic. It is a sociable species that organises into prides. Several adult males, associated females, and cubs make up a lion's pride. Female lions typically hunt in packs and target huge ungulates as their primary prey. Although some lions scavenge when opportunities arise and have been known to hunt humans, lions normally do not actively seek out and prey on humans. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
